Anime Themed Wallpaper Automator


This project is currently on ice as other programs are taking my time.

This program monitors konachan.com, yande.re, and alpha.wallhaven.cc.

Dynamicly will request links from the db to make sure they will work for your configuration and pull the wallpaper then set it automatically.  
No longer do I need to keep a index of wallpapers on my hardrive as I just use the index's avaiable for automation.
